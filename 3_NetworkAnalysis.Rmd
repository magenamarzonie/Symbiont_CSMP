-co-occurence network. 
network analysis. nodes reflect the geography. 
from network you extract the important sequences. 

list of sequences that share edges and sequences that do not share edges. 
- how do people challenge networks w variables external to the network?
- cut-offs for the sequences we do not ‘care’ about. and the sequences that we do. 
- remove sequences that are everywhere. 
- keep simplifying until you have threshold where structure is clear. 
i graph
g graph. port for i graph objects straight into ggplot 


How do we identify which sequences are driving these difference? 
- Best way to do presence/absence scores at reefs? 

```{r}
#load sequence data
load("Data/poci_seqs.Rdata")
load("Data/pver_seqs.Rdata")
load("Data/pmea_seqs.Rdata")
load("Data/punk_seqs.Rdata")
load("Data/acro_seqs.Rdata")
```

```{r}
#list of sequences per reef. group by 
pmea_seqs %>% group_by(Reef, name) %>% 
  dplyr::summarise(n = dplyr::n()) %>% 
  spread(key = Reef, value = n)
```

Vignette for ggnet2 (Network analysis) that uses ggplot2 :  https://briatte.github.io/ggnet/
```{r, warning = FALSE}
#install.packages("GGally")
library(GGally)
library(network)
library(sna)
library(ggplot2)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(intergraph)
```


```{r}
